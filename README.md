<h1>Radix Sort in Java, C, and Python</h1>

<strong>Eleandro Girgis</strong> - implementation of radix sort in
java

<strong>Jakob Upton</strong> - implementation of radix sort in python

<strong>Sun Pak</strong> - implementation of radix sort in C, Analysis

<h2>Instructions for Running</h2>

Compile the C file with
<code>gcc bucketSortFileInput.c -o bucketsort</code>
followed by running
<code>python collectResults.py</code>.
The program will print out the average run times given 100 samples across the same data.
